## IaC and Its Benefits 
---
#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) -
- ###### What is this Magic called IaC? 
	- **No More Clicks** - Write down what you want to deploy (VMs, Disks, Apps, etc.) in a human-readable specification. 
	- **Declare Your Infrastructure** - Infrastructure is, for the majority of cases, written declaratively via code but can be procedural (imperative) too! 
	- **Enable DevOps** - Codification of development means it can be tracked in version control enabling better visibility and collaboration across teams. 
	- **Speed, Cost, and Reduced Risk** - Less human intervention during deployment means fewer chances of security flaws, superfluous resources, and more time is saved!
